This is a parking lot simulator. It generates cars to be put into a entry queue. The parking lot itself has a maximum capacity which is determined
by finding a suitable capacity in order to keep the entry queue below 5 cars. Doing this avoids a big pile up of cars trying to enter the parking lot! 

This is the coding I have completed during my time in the course ITI-1121. This course focuses on the JAVA programming language.
